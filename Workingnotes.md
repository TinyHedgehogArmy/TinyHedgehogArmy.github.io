#To do list

##Data creation and cleaning
- [ ] Compile together all the datasets
- [x] Test if scraping google for the annual/financial reports is likely to give useful results (well, they're restricting to 100 per day, but that's OK.
- [ ] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4490983/google-search-with-python/4491058#4491058 (tomorrow :P)
- [ ] Compile list from GiveNow.com.au as well.
- [ ] Start compiling revenue numbers.

##Design
- [ ] Decide on colour scheme
- [x] Start coding the main website page
- [x] Refine logo (either create more block colour, or make all lines same width)
- [ ] Create icons for the three options - list, curated, faq

##Main page
- [ ] Write text
- [ ] Fix logo (add writing to SVG?)
- [ ] Do SEO kind of stuff
- [ ] Create menu bar at top
- [ ] Implement mouseover and other similar behaviour

##Decision page
- http://jsbin.com/carihurugute
- [ ] Put in actual questions!
- [ ] Refine design
- [x] Add in visual representation of the breadcrumb
- [ ] Add in tracking of where we've been
- [x] Tooltips/mouseover information
- [x] Click on breadcrumb to go back to that question (prompt for non-universal questions)

##Results page
- [ ] Decide on what this will look like (both after the decision page and straight)
- [ ] Investigate firebase as an option
- [ ] Actually code all this - depends on whether I use PHP/mySQL or the Firebase option  
- [ ] Make sure that people can come back to their answers! Either by creating an account (hard) or giving each results page a unique URL (slightly less hard?)
