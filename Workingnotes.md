#To do list

##Data creation and cleaning
- [ ] Compile together all the datasets
- [x] Test if scraping google for the annual/financial reports is likely to give useful results (well, they're restricting to 100 per day, but that's OK.
- [ ] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4490983/google-search-with-python/4491058#4491058 (tomorrow :P)
- [ ] Compile list from GiveNow.com.au as well.
- [ ] Start compiling revenue numbers.

##Design
- [x] Decide on colour scheme
- [x] Start coding the main website page
- [x] Refine logo (either create more block colour, or make all lines same width)
- [x] Create icons for the three options - list, curated, faq

##Main page
- [ ] Write text
- [x] Fix logo (add writing to SVG?)
- [ ] Do SEO kind of stuff
- [ ] Create menu bar at top
- [x] Implement mouseover and other similar behaviour
- [ ] Replace SVGs so they degrade gracefully in ie.
- [ ] Fix rendering using in-browser fonts of main SVG

##Decision page
- http://jsbin.com/carihurugute
- http://jsbin.com/yuzako
- http://jsbin.com/regefezololi
- http://jsbin.com/xujut
- [ ] Put in actual questions!
- [ ] Refine design
- [ ] Decide on how it will fit within the larger website structure
- [x] Add in visual representation of the breadcrumb
- [x] Add in tracking of how far through they are
- [x] Tooltips/mouseover information
- [x] Click on breadcrumb to go back to that question (prompt for non-universal questions)
- [ ] Set up cookie so they don't lose progress

##Results page
- [ ] Decide on what this will look like (both after the decision page and straight)
- [ ] Investigate how to pass from javascript to php
- [x] Investigate firebase as an option (weak queries, which is the only reason I need a database in the first place)
- [ ] Actually code in PHP/mySQL  
- [ ] Make sure that people can come back to their answers! Either by creating an account (hard) or giving each results page a unique URL (slightly less hard?)
