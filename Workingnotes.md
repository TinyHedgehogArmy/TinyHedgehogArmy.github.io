#To do list

##Data creation and cleaning
- [ ] Compile together all the datasets
- [x] Test if scraping google for the annual/financial reports is likely to give useful results (answer: no, at least not at 100 results a day).

##Design
- [ ] Decide on colour scheme
- [ ] Start coding the main website page
- [ ] Refine logo (either create more block colour, or make all lines same width)

##Decision page
- [ ] Refine design
- [ ] Add in visual representation of the breadcrumb
- [ ] Add in tracking of where we've been
- [ ] Tooltips/mouseover information
- [ ] Click on breadcrumb to go back to that question (prompt for non-universal questions)

##Results page
- [ ] Decide on what this will look like (both after the decision page and straight)
- [ ] Investigate firebase as an option
- [ ] Actually code all this - depends on whether I use PHP/mySQL or the Firebase option
