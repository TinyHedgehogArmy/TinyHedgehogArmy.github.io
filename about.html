                    <p><strong>Q: Where has all your data come from?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: The majority of the data on ChangePath.com.au has been sourced from the ACNC register. Sadly, the agency was defunded before they were able to start collecting financial data, so financial and transparency data is being collected from publicly available documents.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: Why don't you provide a ratio of money spent on mission activities vs administration (also known as the 'overhead ratio')?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Two reasons. First, there is no standardised reporting of financial data in Australia that would make that possible. Secondly, the majority of serious charity-assessing organisations (including the highly respected Charity Navigator, GuideStar, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance) are actively discouraging using that metric for making decisions about whether a charity is worth donating to. For a full and eloquent summary of the reasons why, see this open letter: http://overheadmyth.com/</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: What is the donations to revenue ratio? Is it better to be larger or smaller?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: The donations to revenue ratio is exactly that - what proportion of the money that the charity receives comes from donations or other fundraising from us average joes? A good way to think about it is this - the higher the ratio (i.e. the closer to 100%), the more dependent on your money that charity is. That isn't necessarily a good thing! It could mean that their researchers win a lot of grants, or they sell goods and services as a business (not fundraising), or they get a lot of money from the government. Look at their annual report in more detail, find out where their money is coming from.
                    <em>Bottom line:</em> Charities with a high ratio 'need' your money more. That doesn't mean they deserve it more. Don't base your decisions solely on this ratio.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: Do you guarantee that your information is correct?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: No. We will do our best to keep this information up to date, but we are not infallible. If you see an error, please fill in the Update Form.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: My charity isn't listed! What do I do?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: If your charity was registered with the ACNC (you can check at the ACNC website), fill in the Update Form, giving the ABN number listed next to your charity in the ACNC lists. If your charity was NOT listed with the ACNC, then you're going to have to fill out the New Charity form. Either way, the new information will need to be cross-checked, so it may be some time before your charity appears on changepath.com.au.</p>

<li>ChangePath is an independent, transparent service to help people who wish to choose a charity to donate to. To remain independent, ChangePath does not accept money from charities in any way that could be seen as a conflict of interest. Rankings and scores cannot be bought.</li>

<h1>General Q&A </h1>


<p><strong>Q: My charity isn't listed! What do I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: If your charity was registered with the ACNC (you can check at the ACNC website), fill in the Update Form, giving the ABN number listed next to your charity in the ACNC lists. If your charity was NOT listed with the ACNC, then you're going to have to fill out the New Charity form. Either way, the new information will need to be cross-checked, so it may be some time before your charity appears on changepath.com.au.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Where has all your data come from?</strong></p>
<p>A: The majority of the data on ChangePath.com.au has been sourced from the ACNC register. Sadly, the agency was defunded before they were able to start collecting financial data, so financial and transparency data is being collected from publicly available documents. This means that the majority of data was entered by charities themselves, meaning that coding is currently inconsistent across different charities, even those in the same group.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why don't you provide a ratio of money spent on mission activities vs administration (also known as the 'overhead ratio')?</strong></p>
<p>A: Two reasons. First, there is no standardised reporting of financial data in Australia that would make that possible.

<h1>Financial Q&A </h1>

<p><strong>What are the rules for what counts as 'donations/bequests'?</strong></p>
<p>Donations/bequests/sponsorships is meant to be a guide of how much money is recieved by the charity from the general public (as opposed to goverment grants or service provision). This means it must be calculated based on the numbers provided by the charity. As many charities use different accounting methods, this number <strong>may not be comparable between charities.</strong></p>
<p>Calculating the number is done using the following criteria:</p>
>>>>>>> origin/master
<ul>
<li>Sponsorships are included</li>
<li>Fundraising including events is included</li>
<li>Grants are not included</li>
<li>Money raised through commercial activities (selling goods, providing services) is NOT included</li>
<li>Membership subscriptions are not included</li>
<li>If a number combines items that both would and wouldn't be included (i.e. memberships and donations), it is not included</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the rules used for revenue collection?</p>
<ul>
<li>'Consolidated' numbers are used where split into consolidated/parent</li>

<h2>Transparency score Q&A </h2>
 </div>
                <div class="maintextbox">
=======

<p><strong>Q: Are all the revenue numbers, ratios and so forth strictly comparable?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. Different charities have different reporting periods, reporting methods, and accounting eccentricities. This means that all numbers in these tables cannot be directly compared to one another accurately, and should be used as a guide rather than as a hard-and-fast way of differentiating between charities.</p>

<h1>Transparency score Q&A </h1>

>>>>>>> origin/master
<p><strong>Q: What determines the transparency score?</strong></p>
<p>A: The transparency score is a blunt instrument at best. In future it will take into account more factors, but currently it simply measures whether an Annual Report or other reporting of annual events at the charity exists. This is an indication of how willing the charity is to share its finances and operations, year on year, with its supporters.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 stars: Full annual report and financial report available and easily accessible from the website, or substantial financial information included in Annual Report (i.e. breakdown of revenue and expenses).</li>
<li>2 stars: Annual report available but missing key financial data. No financial report available.</li>
<li>1 star: Annual report available but doesn't list any financial data, or annual report available for previous years but not for current year.</li>
<li>No stars: No annual report available.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q: How reliable are your listings?</strong></p>
<p>A: The listings represent a snapshot, a moment in time. Charity websites can change rapidly - it's entirely possible for a charity to go from no stars to three stars in a few hours with a few simple website changes. These rankings will be updated regularly, or when we are notified of a change.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What if a charity is misrepresented by the transparency score? </strong></p>
<p>A: Ratings change over time. If you believe a charity has been misrepresented, or a charity has become more transparent by putting it's financial information online and that isn't reflected in our score, please let us know by filling in the Update Form.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What about if a charity has an annual or financial report, but you need to email them to get it?</strong></p>
<p>A: Well, that's not very transparent, is it? All supporters should have easy and immediate access to the report without going through a gatekeeper or having to provide a reason.</p>

<p><strong>Q: When do charities have to have their annual reports online?</strong></p>
<p>A: Charities are given a full financial year to put up their annual reports - i.e. 13/14 annual reports must be up by June 2015. While this is a substantial amount of time, the transparency score isn't meant to be a 'who is most efficient at putting up their reports' competition. It's judged that, if it takes longer than a full year to create and put online a report, they're not being very transparent. However, if they have previously put up annual reports, they're given a one-star rating. For trying.</p>
