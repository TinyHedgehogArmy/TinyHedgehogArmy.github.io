        <h2>Many causes, many charities.</h2>
        <p>The world is full of problems to solve. There are diseases to cure, injustices to right, animals to save, and ideas to protect. These problems compete for our attention every day, trying to catch our attention, our passion, and often our wallets. Inevitably, tomorrow, there will be a new cause or problem, begging for our attention.</p>
        <p>How do you know what to do?</p>
        <p>ChangePath aims to help you navigate the seas of problems facing humanity and the planet we live on. By helping you to narrow down the causes you're interested in, ChangePath helps you to emerge from indecision and start making a difference. It's not a decision we can make for you, but we can help. Our guide will take you through potential causes, helping you narrow down who you want to assist.</p>

        <h2>Sorting the wheat from the chaff</h2>
        <p>At last count, there are over 60,000 charities registered in Australia, covering almost every conceivable cause. How can you narrow down exactly who should get your hard-earned money, or your valuable time?</p>
        <p>ChangePath is the only organisation in Australia that provides transparency rankings for a wide range of charities, as well as financial data. Compare charities by size, revenue, and donations received, as well as by whether they make financial data available. </p>
        <p>The full list of charities will grow in time, and more information will be added to improve your ability to make decisions.</p>

        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>ChangePath exists to shine a light on charitable giving in Australia. We're here to help you make better decisions about who you support and why.</p>
        <p>Given our emphasis on transparency, it would be very odd if we weren't upfront about our methodologies, our data sources, and the limitations of what we do. We're under no illusions that this is perfect yet - there's a lot more to do before we can claim to be an authoritative source on charitable giving.</p>
