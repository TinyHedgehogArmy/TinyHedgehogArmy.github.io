<h1>And we're off</h1>
<p>Hosting with GitHub pages and publishing straight to there.</p>
<p>So, things to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put in Jquery - is that enough to deal with the various moving parts? Probably, realistically.</li>
<li>Create a few different wireframes</li>
<li>Try dynamically moving the different elements</li>
<li>NOTE: make sure it works on all screen sizes this time</li>
<li>Then try linking up the various elements to the movement logic</li>
<li>Sky's the limit!</li>
</ul>
